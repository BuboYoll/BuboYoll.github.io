# Guilt and high standard

High standard does not always lead to high productivity, achievement, and most important, goals.

The key is to focus on **goals**, instead of **optimization**. 

## High standard somtimes leads to guilt.
I hate repeating works, and I always seek for a more efficient solution towards the current problem, even if sometimes figuring out the solution takes more time than tackle with the problem in a dumb way. This is mainly because I want **optimization**, which makes me feel good.

However, most of the time when I face new problems, or some challenges that itself does not have a shortcut, I am likely to spend too much time at the beginning, hestitating and wandering where to put my first foorprint on. Thisleads to **guilt** afterwards.


## Where guilt further leads to?
Looking back to my high school and college, I play beforeI study or work, which essentially using guilt as a motivation, and it was very harmful. Sometimes if I can not handle the guilt and pressure, the pattern of **failing with abandon** appears.

In conclusion, this kind of guilt is caused in two ways
1. High standard
2. Poor execution

## How to set a good standard?
Think of myself a reinforcement learning model, where I can set the reward function all by myself:
$$
r(\text{today's performance}, \text{my standard})
$$
where currently, I am not building a good reward function, which is,
$$
\frac{\partial r}{\partial \text{today's performance}} > 0, \quad \frac{\partial r}{\partial \text{my standard}} < 0
$$
Ideally, setting standard should help improving myself, which means the partial derivative should be greater than 0.

**This could be done by setting a proper stander** . 

In order to do this, I should
- Set **goals** instead of **goal of optimization** .
- Record time for repeanting tasks, for example, reading papers, doing assignment, etc.
- Estimate the time needed for new tasks as pestimistic as possible. (Imaging bet 1000$ with someone that you can finish the task within this time.)
